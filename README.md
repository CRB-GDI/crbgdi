# Creating Variables With Types
1. To practice creating variables, we’re going to write a program that prints information about a dog to the console. We’ll be working with the types string, int, double, and bool.

    First, create two string variables. The first one is called name and has the value "Shadow". The second one is called breed and has the value "Golden Retriever".
2. Next, create a variable to hold the dog's age. Name the variable _age_ and store the value _5_
3. Next, create a variable to hold the weight.  Name the variable _weight_ and store the value _65.22_
4. Next, create a variable that can be either true or false. Name the variable _spayed_ and set it to _true_
5. Use _Console.WriteLine()_ to print each variable to the console.

**Expected Output *(no blank lines between)***

> Shadow
> 
> Golden Retriever
> 
> 5
> 
> 65.22
> 
> True
